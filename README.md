# F1Simulation

## Implement an Android App for a Car Simulator using the GUI template below:


### There are 3 main layout parts:
1.	Top Left: a track with 2 lanes, on which the RED car moves in real time
2.	Top Right: a dynamic display of the main metrics we are interested in as the car moves 
3.	Bottom: controls for the driver to Start/Stop engine, Accelerate (increase engine RPM), Brake (with friction against the rotating wheels), and a Steering Wheel (showing the Steering Angle with respect to the front of the car always). The Steering Wheel could be controlled by Touch, Tap, or Drag.
